### SPARC Data Conversion to NWB Format
1. The GitHub repository is proposed to convert data[1] into NWB format.
2. The NWB Format is not a rigid format and do not have a stable folder/data structure. The folder/data structure heavily depends on the process of experimentation and the data being collected in the experiments.
3. We will be working to convert files from json format to nab format. Any other storage format such as xlsx, and csv can be converted to json for further conversion.
